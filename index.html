<p>I am a Senior at Bob Jones university studying Communication Disorders with the hope of becoming a Speech Language Pathology.I am currently in practicum and running therapy with elementary school children. </p>

<p>I love working with the autism community and have the priviledge to work with a low-functioning, non-verbal woman in the summers. She is a joy to spend time with and has taught me a lot about love, patience, and compassion.</p>
  
<p>I also enjoy learning sign language and spending time with the Deaf. Summer after my sophomore year, I spent two months in Cape Town, South Africa volunteering in the Deaf community with an organization named Hands With Words. This opportunity pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me to cherish communication and the ability to connect with others.</p>
